              <p>
               We charge a final value fee when your item or relisted item sells, or if we determine that you intended to complete a sale outside of eBay.
              </p>
              <p>
               Final value fees are calculated as a percentage of the total amount the buyer pays, including shipping and handling. Sales tax isn't included.

               </a>
               , we charge you a final value fee based on the total amount of the sale even if your item doesn't sell. In this situation, the total amount of the sale is determined as follows:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                <strong>
                 Auction-style listing format:
                </strong>
                The total amount of the sale is the auction start price, the Buy It Now price (if applicable), the reserve price (if applicable), or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is highest.
               </li>

                 Fixed price listing format:

               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               When you use a zero insertion fee listing and pay no insertion fee, you still have to pay the final value fee.

              <p>
               If your account doesn't meet our minimum performance standards for the US at the time of sale, there will be an additional 4 percentage points fee on the standard final value fees at the time the item sells. For example, a final value fee would increase from 6.15% to 10.15%. In some cases we cap final value fees depending on the category and if a seller has a Store subscription. However, this additional 4 percentage points fee is not subject to maximum final value fee caps and will be applied to the total amount of the sale, including shipping.

              <p>
               We calculate final values fees on shipping costs based on the shipping service the buyer chooses.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, when you offer one-day or international service and the buyer selects it, the final value fee on shipping is based on whichever service is less expensive, so either:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>

               </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
               For example, if a buyer chooses international shipping and you specified free shipping as your first domestic option, you don't pay any final value fees on shipping for that item.
              </p>
              <p>
               If one-day or international shipping is the only service you offer, the final value fee for shipping will be based on that service.
              </p>
              <p>
               If you're in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, or Vietnam and your item isn't located in the US, final value fees on shipping are always calculated based on the shipping option your buyer chooses.

                 You're selling a rare vintage camera using a 5-day duration. You select a starting price ofÂ $199Â and offerÂ calculated shipping. You've listed fewer than 50 items this month. You are meeting our minimum performance standards.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You add the following advanced listing upgrades:
                </p>
                <ul>
                 <li>
                  To highlight the condition of the camera, you add Gallery Plus.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  To make your listing available to more customers, you add International Site Visibility.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  You add a reserve price ofÂ $400.
                 </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                 The winning bid for the camera isÂ $7,800. Shipping to the buyer isÂ $30, so the total amount of the sale isÂ $7,830.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The final value fee isÂ $750. (10% of $7,830 is $783, but the maximum charge for auction-style final value fees is $750).

               <p>
                The fees for listing and selling a vehicle on eBay Motors are different to those in other categories, but the overall structure is the same. We charge an insertion fee when you create a listing and a successful listing fee when your vehicle is sold. You'll also payÂ fees for any advanced listing upgrades and supplemental services you use.

If you choose to <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/creating-managing-listings/adding-category-listing?id=4149\">list your item in two categories\u003C/a>, you also pay an insertion fee for the second category.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Insertion fees are nonrefundable if your item doesn&#39;t sell. If your auction-style listing ends in a sale, the insertion fee will be credited back (<a href=\"/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/fee-credits?id=4128\">exclusions apply\u003C/a>).\u003C/p>\n\n<p>If you relist&nbsp;your item, we charge an insertion fee for the original listing and each time your item is relisted. However, your monthly zero insertion fee listings can cover each of your relisted items until they&#39;re used up. Relisting applies in most categories, but there are <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/creating-managing-listings/relisting-items?id=4147\">some exclusions\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Zero insertion fee listings\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>Every month, you get up to 50 zero insertion fee listings, or more if you have an <a href=\"/help/selling/ebay-stores/opening-ebay-store?id=4092\">eBay Store\u003C/a>. You&#39;ll only pay insertion fees once you&#39;ve used up those listings.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/selling-limits?id=4107\">selling limits\u003C/a> apply and certain categories are excluded from the zero insertion fee listings offer. Also, If you&#39;re a private seller,&nbsp;you&#39;re only eligible for zero insertion fee listings when you list in the country that you registered with. For example, if you have a registered address in the US, you&#39;ll only receive zero insertion fee listings on eBay.com.&nbsp;Learn more about <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/listing-tips/free-listings?id=4163\">how zero insertion fee listings work\u003C/a>, including the terms and exclusions for those listings.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Duplicate listings and multiple items\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>If you create a duplicate auction-style listing for the same item, we charge an insertion fee per listing (one for the original and another for the duplicate), even if the listing doesn&#39;t appear on eBay for its full <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/selecting-listing-duration?id=4652\">listing duration\u003C/a>. Consider scheduling your auctions to end at different times, so if a bidder doesn&#39;t win your first listing, they have a chance to bid on your duplicate listing. Read more about our <a href=\"/help/policies/listing-policies/duplicate-listings-policy?id=4255\">Duplicate listings policy\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>For <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/listing-tips/bulk-listings?id=4160\">listings with multiple items\u003C/a>, including <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/creating-managing-listings/creating-listings-variations?id=4150\">listings with variations\u003C/a>, you only pay one insertion fee. We calculate the insertion fee based on the total start price of your listing, which is the item price multiplied by the quantity. For example, if you list 10 items at $4.00 each, the total start price is $40. If you list 100 items at $4.00 each, the total start price is $400.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Good &#39;Til Cancelled listings\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>For Good &#39;Til Cancelled listings, we charge an insertion fee every 30-day period. Your listing will renew automatically every 30 days unless your item sells before that timeframe, you <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/creating-managing-listings/cancelling-listing?id=4146\">cancel your listing\u003C/a>, or your listing violates an <a href=\"/help/account/policies/az-index-policies?id=4649\">eBay policy\u003C/a> and we end your listing. Good &#39;Til Cancelled listings count toward your monthly <a href=\"/help/selling/listings/listing-tips/free-listings?id=4163\">zero insertion fee listings\u003C/a>. Fee amounts are based on the terms in effect when the listing goes live and when it renews.\u003C/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"section2\">Final value fees\u003C/h2>\n\n<p>We charge a final value fee when your item or relisted item sells, or if we determine that you intended to complete a sale outside of eBay.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>Final value fees are calculated as a percentage of the total amount the buyer pays, including shipping and handling. Sales tax isn&#39;t included.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>If you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of <a href=\"/help/policies/payment-policies/offers-buy-sell-outside-ebay-policy?id=4272\">buying or selling outside of eBay\u003C/a>, we charge you a final value fee based on the total amount of the sale even if your item doesn&#39;t sell. In this situation, the total amount of the sale is determined as follows:\u003C/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Auction-style listing format:\u003C/strong> The total amount of the sale is the auction start price, the Buy It Now price (if applicable), the reserve price (if applicable), or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is highest.\u003C/li>\n\t<li><strong>Fixed price listing format:\u003C/strong> The total amount of the sale is the fixed price or the price identified between the buyer and seller, whichever is higher.\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n<p>When you use a zero insertion fee listing and pay no insertion fee, you still have to pay the final value fee.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>If your account doesn&#39;t meet our minimum performance standards for the US at the time of sale, there will be an additional 4 percentage points fee on the standard final value fees at the time the item sells. For example, a final value fee would increase from 6.15% to 10.15%. In some cases we cap final value fees depending on the category and if a seller has a Store subscription. However, this additional 4 percentage points fee is not subject to maximum final value fee caps and will be applied to the total amount of the sale, including shipping. We&#39;ll indicate which listings are subject to this additional fee on your <a href=\"http://cgi3.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MfcISAPICommand=ViewAccount\" target=\"_blank\">Account Summary<span class=\"g-hdn\"> - opens in new window or tab\u003C/span>\u003C/a>.

Above Standard and eBay Top-rated Sellers will not be affected.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Final value fees on shipping\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>We calculate final values fees on shipping costs based on the shipping service the buyer chooses.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>However, when you offer one-day or international service and the buyer selects it, the final value fee on shipping is based on whichever service is less expensive, so either:\u003C/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The one-day or international shipping service you offer in your listing, or\u003C/li>\n\t<li>The first domestic service in your listing that isn&#39;t one-day\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ul>\n\n<p>For example, if a buyer chooses international shipping and you specified free shipping as your first domestic option, you don&#39;t pay any final value fees on shipping for that item.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>If one-day or international shipping is the only service you offer, the final value fee for shipping will be based on that service.\u003C/p>\n\n<p>If you&#39;re in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, or Vietnam and your item isn&#39;t located in the US, final value fees on shipping are always calculated based on the shipping option your buyer chooses.\u003C/p>\n\n<h3>Final value fee credit\u003C/h3>\n\n<p>If for some reason the buyer ends up not paying, you need to either <a href=\"/help/selling/getting-paid/cancelling-transaction?id=4136\">cancel the sale\u003C/a> or report it as an <a href=\"/help/selling/getting-paid/resolving-unpaid-items?id=4137\">unpaid item\u003C/a> in order to be eligible for a final value <a href=\"/help/selling/fees-credits-invoices/fee-credits?id=4128\">fee credit\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\n<h2 id=\"section3\">Basic fees for most categories\u003C/h2>\n\n<p>In the table below, we outline the basic fees for items listed in most categories and the number of zero insertion fee listings you&#39;ll get each month.\u003C/p>\n\n<table class=\"standard\">\n\t<thead>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Category\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Insertion fee\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t<td>Final value fee:<br />\n\t\t\t% of total amount of sale\u003C/td>\n\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\u003C/thead>\n\t<tbody>\n\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t<td>Standard fees for most categories, including Motors Parts &amp; Accessories and Automotive Tools and Supplies.
