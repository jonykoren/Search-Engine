           <img alt="NeweBay" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7404" height="340" src="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423072417im_/http://www.ebaypartnernetworkblog.com/en/files/2013/01/NeweBay.jpg" width="565"/>

         </p>
         <p>
          Since we set out on the process of revamping our pricing, we’ve focused on two key elements: the need for transparency and the ability for publishers to be able to optimize. Today, we’re excited to provide details on a couple of the major components that you can focus on to succeed when the new pricing structure launches on October 1, 2013.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           Category Rates
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          We believe that category plays an important role in driving higher-value traffic to eBay. Because of this, program pricing will be based on category-level commission rates. The rates will vary for each of our 13 programs worldwide and you can see them
          <strong>
           <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160423072417/http://www.ebaypartnernetworkblog.com/en/usratecard/" target="_blank" title="Category Rate Card">
            HERE
           </a>
          </strong>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          For example, let’s say you drive a visitor to eBay, who ends up with a winning bid on a laptop with a total sale amount of $500 and revenue of $40. If the Electronics category rate was set at 55%, your earnings would be $22, or 4.4% of the total sale amount.
         </p>
         <p>
          <b>
           New and Reactivated Buyer Bonus
          </b>
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition to competitive rates across categories, the new pricing will add a significant bonus for driving transactions from new and reactivated buyers (defined as users who have not purchased in the last 12 months) to eBay. For every new or reactivated buyer sent to eBay, you will receive a bonus of 200%.
         </p>
         <p>
          So in the previous laptop example, you’d receive an additional bonus of 200% x $22, or $44, bringing your total earnings for that item to $66, or 13.2% of total sale – if purchased by a new or reactivated customer.

          As a reminder, our new pricing will modify the way we track both “Buy It Now” and “Bid” items. For a “Buy It Now” item, you will be compensated if a user makes a purchase within 24 hours. For “Bid” items where a bid is placed within 24 hours of the initial click,  you are credited for winning auctions for 10 days, which is the maximum length that an auction can last.

         <p>
          To earn more in our program, you’ll want to be sure to leverage the Transaction Download Report. In addition to the Customer Frequency value, you’ll also be able to see the exact earnings that you’re paid on each transaction. When you leverage this data along with tracking parameters like Campaign ID and Custom ID, you’ll be able to segment your most valuable traffic and learn where to focus your efforts.

          <b>
           Please note:
          </b>
          Those of you that automatically import the Transaction Download Report should check to make sure the renamed column “Earnings” does not interfere with your scripts. There was no data in this field previously. For those that were on CPA pricing you have a column labeled “Commission” in the report. The title of this column will change to “Earnings” for consistency, but otherwise no changes will be made to your earnings amounts.
         </p>
         <p>
          We appreciate your support and look forward to our continued partnership. Please let us know if you have any questions, and stay tuned for more information over the coming weeks.

             Very relieved to see that the years of work building up a community wrapped around a collectibles market will continue to be a viable business model through EPN.  I will still wait to pass judgement once I get a few months into the new system but that 60% rate was welcome news this morning and I look forward to plugging ahead with new projects this fall to grow things and hopefully pick up some of those new users that will be coveted in the new model.

             Wondering if ePN might be able to publish exact category numbers for the new rate card?
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m guessing “Parts &amp; Accesories” refers to that part of eBay Motors, but “Lifestyle” I’m not too sure about. “Media” = DVDs, CDs, and books? Might not matter much for North America, but there’s a percentage variance for EU/AU.
            </p>
            <p>
             I am also assuming that a rate for any top-level meta category also applies to all sub-categories.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks!

             The wording is unclear.
            </p>
            <p>
             You say “if bid is placed within 24 hours, then window is extended from 7 to 10 days”.
            </p>
            <p>
             Does this mean if the bid is placed after 48 hours, I still get the comission if it is the winning bid, as this is within the 7 day timeframe?

             Should but many still think it’s a 24hr window for both BIN and auctions but it’s not written that way really. Instead of

            <p>
             “As a reminder, our new pricing will modify the way we track both “Buy It Now” and “Bid” items.

For “Bid” items where a bid (not necessarily the Winning Bid) is placed within 24 hours of the initial click, we will extend the period in which you are credited for winning auctions from seven to 10 days, which is the maximum length that an auction can last.”
            </p>
            <p>
             maybe it should have been written like

             So there is no compensation if a bid is placed e.g. after 48 hours? Really?
            </p>
            <p>
             Sorry, but that makes the the whole thing useless. Most people aren’t gonna bid immediately, as EVERYONE knows that the bid should be in the last couple of minutes or seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
             This will vanish &gt; 50 % of conversions.
            </p>
            <p>
             I can understand that you limit the time frame for buy it now, but for auction style listings, this is absolutely inacceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
             You should really rethink this strategy, as I think many (including me) will quit the programme as this policy refuses to compensate for refferals appropriately.

             Just saw an interesting post on another forum. What happens if the person bids on an auction that has a BIN option after the 24 hrs. Do we get credit or not?

             I agree. An acceptable compromise might be to include if the buyer adds the item to their watch list within 24 hours.

             OK! So it looks like “Action from the visitor” (Buy for BIN, Bid for auctions) with 24 hrs of initial click will earn the commission.
             <br/>
             SOooo… Buy from BIN is ok (we may not have disadvantage) BUT definitely
             <br/>
             bid in 24 hours for auction is “Disaster” for publishers.
             <br/>
             I don’t think anyone will bid within 24 hours (unless the auction is ending in 24 hours time), normally people put in their watch list, see the trend of bidding and wait till the last 24 hours. So indirectly we will lose most of earning from bid winnings.
             <br/>
             This is my take on these new changes!! fingers crossed

             Scott,
            </p>
            <p>
             This needs to be made clear. How long after they click from our site can a bid on a non-BIN capable auction give us credit?
            </p>
            <p>
             1) For a true auction item with no BIN option – Is it 7 days unless a click is made in the first 24 hrs then it is 10 days?
            </p>
            <p>
             2) For an auction with a BIN – If a bid is made after 24 hrs and the auction closes in the 7 day window, do we get credit?
            </p>
            <p>
             3) Now for a BIN or an auction with BIN  where they use the BIN option – any BIN after 24 hrs is useless to us.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I read the post/email –
            </p>
            <p>
             #1 – We get credit for 7 days unless a bid is placed in the first 24 hrs then it’s 10 days.
            </p>
            <p>
             #2 – Like #1 as the action is a bid and not a BIN action
            </p>
            <p>
             #3 – As everyone reads it – no credit after 24 hrs for either a true BIN or an auction where a BIN is done.

             ePN, you should really keep track of auctions activities for 7 days (and not the ridiculous 1 day you are proposing).

             We deserve commisions for those sales.

             How was it before ? They had one week instead of 24h to bid right ?

             If true, it will be a nightmare for all publishers.

             I read somewhere that the eBay fees for sellers are 10% upto a maximum of
             <br/>
             £75.  I assume the most I could earn on the sale of one item is £60 (80%) of £75 on a fashion item costing £750 and above?  Few months ago I thought eBay made revenue of £163 on one high end item (my commission was quite nice too that month).  I am not really sure what strategy to develop.  I was hoping to sell a few Bugattis and Ferraris this year, but I don’t know if there is any particular motivation for the affiliate to promote the high end stuff?

             Thank you for your comments and feedback on the new pricing. Since our announcement yesterday there have been questions about the length of the referral period and exactly how that will work in our new pricing model. Currently there is 7-day referral period for all actions. When pricing launches on October 1st, we’ll be moving to a 24-hour referral period.  If there is a bid on an auction within 24 hours of the initial click, you will get credit for a winning bid even if the auction doesn’t close in 24 hours. Under QCP, publisher earnings were reduced as the Bid/Buy It Now occurred farther away from the click. Because this latency factor is not in the new model, all Bids/Buy It Now’s are paid at the full posted rate.

             The strategy of ebay bidding is to bid as last minute as possible. The new pricing model will not compensate me for my referrals. If I refer someone to ebay and they don’t bid within 24 hours but bid 7 days later, I will not get paid. So what is my incentive for sending my readers to ebay?

             Isn’t it obvious by now that the label ‘exciting’ attached to an announcement actually means that publisher earnings will drop ?    Not surprising really, as corporates always dress up bad news with euphemisms.   Once it gets below our threshold, we’ll be just putting up PPC ads or CPM’s.  Far less hassle and generally not subject to ‘exciting’ news.

             The TDR needs to have the Event Date also changed to Event TimeStamp or at the very least just change the data. As it is now you can have a Click with a time stamp of Oct first and an Event with Oct 2nd and and we could or wouldn’t get paid depending on when during the 2nd the event occurred.

             I second this request. With the new 24hr window, the timestamp of the Event is much more important. A resolution finer than by-day (like the Click Timestamp field currently sports) would be quite helpful as we could then calculate click-to-event durations with better accuracy, giving us more information in our analyses.

             It sounds like I’ll be saying sayonara to ePN after all these years of being a loyal publisher. The new pricing system sounds completely absurd. Expecting people to bid on an item within 24hrs of clicking on a link is ridiculous. As said before, everybody knows the strategy to winning an auction on eBay is to bid as late as possible. Sure, there’s the auctions here and there where people bid as soon as possible, but I know for a fact that those auctions aren’t common in my niche. The customers in my niche that I refer to eBay wait until the very last minute to place a bid, and with good reason, too. Why start a bidding war and keep driving the price up when there’s a good chance you can sneak a bid in towards the end and come out as the winner for a fraction of the price had you started bidding the moment you found the item. I can already see myself losing a ton of revenue due to this new pricing plan, and with that I’m very disappointed and considering my options for replacing ePN.
            </p>
            <p>
             Time to get back to work as these may be my last few weeks with ePN. Gotta make the little time that’s left count.

             While I am actually very nervous about how the new pricing will play out when we get to October 1, I am intrigued by the range of comments here and in the forum. We have only been given “parts of the equation” so far. The 24hr cookie is disturbing some, the 200% bonus for Type 1 is encouraging others.
            </p>
            <p>
             Forgive me if I don’t understand this, but I am saddened by the sheer vitriol of some of the negative comments I have seen when, at the time of writing, we don’t know 2 important things.
             <br/>
             1. We don’t know the whole formula for the pricing structure. We have only been given insight into parts of it
             <br/>
             2. We haven’t seen the pricing take effect yet.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have been told repeatedly that the new pricing will be revealed to us gradually over the course of September. It’s now 14 September. So according to my calculations (and correct me if I’m wrong) but that leaves 16 days left for further insights into the new pricing model. Even once it starts, I assume we won’t have been given the full formula.
            </p>
            <p>
             Another thing is that Auctions on ebay are less popular by the day. BIN is increasingly the way people buy. Which I would assume would be more likely to be done within a 24 hour window.
            </p>
            <p>
             My thoughts, before I jump out of the window in sheer panic. Luckily I live in a bungalow.

             Here’s how i use eBay personally :
            </p>
            <p>
             Find item, put on watch list. Wait until last day, and then see if i want to bid or not.
            </p>
            <p>
             Here’s how i experience items selling when i sell them on eBay:
            </p>
            <p>
             List items. Watch as the watchers grow in numbers. See a few bids here and there. In the last day (usually the last 2 hours) the bids jump up in an exponential scale.
            </p>
            <p>
             Now, going on this new model,  where eBay users have method of ‘watch until the last day’ bid, we won’t be credited for the click. Not good!
            </p>
            <p>
             Here’s the question:
            </p>
            <p>
             What if someone finds my site, goes to eBay, and looks at a bunch of items in their chosen category (ie; iPhones). The initial click is stamped on a sunday at 7PM. They find a bunch of items, and actually bid on one item. This item goes to another bidder, so the person then bids on another item. Again, they loose the bid. Fast forward to three days later, and they actually win an action.
            </p>
            <p>
             No credit for us the referrers, even thou we have:
            </p>
            <p>
             1. Driven targetted traffic to eBay
             <br/>
             2. Enticed the user to bid
             <br/>
             3. They win an action and generate income for eBay
            </p>
            <p>
             eBay’s auctions last from 7 to 10 days. That’s the nature of auctions. What your proposing with the 24 hours policy is an insult to the nature of what we’ve put energy into.
            </p>
            <p>
             Credit us for what we deserve – not what makes more profit for eBay.
            </p>

             Stupid question, but…  Does this mean that the EPC method will be wiped out and will revert back to a system that was similiar to that of 4-5 years ago?

             What you are saying is not correct.
            </p>
            <p>
             The relevant parts of the pricing model have been given to us. The most important part is the 24 h cookie. And that is simply not acceptable. You don’t have any benefit of a 200% bonus, if your sale is not even considered because it’s not within the 24 h Timeframe.

             Yes but instead of getting credit for when a person clicked from your site near the start of an auction but waits until near the end of the auction to bid as before under CJ, old EPN and QCP (less credit the longer between click and bid) to only 24 hrs to get them to BIN/BID (doesn’t have to be the winning bid but they still have to win the auction)

             What we do know is that if the person does not do anything in the 24 hr window after clicking from your site you get nothing. Unlike now where you get a diminishing amount the longer time from click to action. Take a look at you TDR (transaction download report) for last month and sort by eBay Item then by Type then by Event Date. This should group the actions for an item together with the bids first by date (if multiple bids), followed by the WB count then the WBR.
            </p>
            <p>
             1) Look at the first entry for an item that has a WBR entry below it. This is something that you got something for. If the Event date is the same as the date on the Click Timestamp then you would get paid for it for it. If the date is the next day you may or may not get paid for it (depends on the time). If the date is two days later or more then nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes the bonus helps but a new user buying/winning a low dollar item will get you a small bonus but under the CJ, old EPN you got the same bonus as if they bought/won a HIGH dollar item. Under QCP the bonus seemed to vary but leaned toward the higher reward. I understand this to a point but what’s not to say that a low $ initial purchase user is worth less in the longer run than a high $ initial user that never again buys/bids. And yes the response was harsh but the initial announcement sounded like there was a 24 hr BIN window but the BID window was 7 days and got extended to 10 days if they bid in the first 24 hrs. Then it was changed to clear up the confusion and both are 24 hrs. And not to be mean to Scott as he is speaking for the higher ups (I don’t want your job Scott) the response was that before you got paid less as the time from click to action increased but now you get paid the full credit. Yes but now you only get credit if the first action is in the first 24 hrs. Run last months and get a feel which way it’s going to be for you.

            <p>
             The problem is that it takes time to make any adjustments that we might think could help us do better under the new setup. EPN/eBay tends to either give you little lead time (or next to none) or dribble out the details. They announce this way back in April. Also they tend to make MAJOR changes right before or even during the BUSIEST time of the year. It’s like Walmart deciding to rearrange the layout of the store for Christmas after they had placed the Christmas displays.Doesn’t happen as Walmart studied before hand what the best layout was and where the best place to put the displays months before they did it. Like it’s been posted elsewhere eBay/EPN as a seller and an affiliate, it’s getting harder to make money.

            </p>
            <p>
             I’m sorry that I appear to be mistaken. My understanding was that we dont know the full equation yet for determing our payouts under the new system. So the way some affiliates are asserting, is that other parameters/variables such as history (short/medium/long term) will not be considered, neither will anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
             Ok, I get it now. So the ONLY factors determining how much we get paid is basically what is laid out in the ebay posting above.
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m not sure whether everythng I said was incorrect or just parts of what I said. So sorry about that.

            <p>
             I tell you what, I totally 110% agree with your point that we have been given very little lead time with how to adapt our strategies to deal with the new pricing methodology. We have been told that armageddon is coming many months ago like you rightly say, but no direction until recently in terms of what cave we need to jump into. I love your Walmart analogy. Spot on. That said, it still remains to be seen what other information (very belated I agree) that will come our way hopefully before D-Day. Some of that info may change our opinions.
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding the 24hr cookie. Do we know how much the payout to us diminishes after the 24hr window? Is there an equation for that? It could be that the payout already diminishes at a large rate after 24 hours anyway?
            </p>
            <p>
             Regarding the bonus payout. Yes I totally agree with you about the fact that we’re going to see very little compensation if the buyer buys a pack of 6 pencils in the 24 hr period. Having said that, as it stands right now, do we know for sure that the ongoing value of that user will not be considered at all? I probably missed it, but can we all say for certain that a user’s long term buying habits on ebay are now totally excluded from the equation? Is that confirmed? Maybe it is. I literally do not know. To throw in an example: we get a new user to sign up and buy said packet of pencils within 24hours. We get pennies. OK. Then, said user returns to ebay 3 weeks later and buys a Ferrari. Do we get nothing? If we don’t, where does ebay say that?
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally I totaly agree with your point about the 24hr bidding deadline being really harsh in an environment where people tend to use the watch list until the last minute (Anteck also made this his main point – thank you, Anteck), but I am not clear about the current system with the diminishing payout over time. Scott alluded to it in some of his replies. Does the payout currently diminish by the minute from initial click? Or, by the hour? Because if it’s by the day, then by extension, we are currently getting the “full payout” anyway, if a bid is placed within 24 hours? Yes? No?
            </p>
            <p>
             Anyway, that’s my 20 cents for you.

            <p>
             Is that true regarding a limit to the payouts? Like you say, what’s the point of getting people to buy Ferrari’s or what have you if you’re not going to see the juicy commission. Does anyone know for sure? that is a BIG point and a really important one you made there. Thanks!

             Hi Ken,
            </p>
            <p>
             I’m, curious why you think there’s more to the system that hasn’t been announced. Looks like all of the pieces are on the table now.
            </p>
            <p>
             As to your Ferrari question, ” you will be compensated if a user makes a purchase within 24 hours” is a pretty straightforward description of how it will work. The new system isn’t offering you anything beyond that, certainly not three weeks later.
            </p>
            <p>
             They have to buy that Ferrari on Day1. But if they are new to eBay, tripling that commission will certainly beat a box of pencils. Though that will likely be a rarer event.

             Hi Scott, please confirm…
            </p>
            <p>
             “For “Bid” items where a bid (not necessarily the Winning Bid) is placed within 24 hours of the initial click,
             <br/>
             you are credited for winning auctions for 10 days,”
            </p>
            <p>
             Not to beat a dead horse here. But that means the specific item that was bid on, not all winning auctions?  For instance: click…..bid on item1 on Day1…bid and win item2 on Day4…don’t win item1….item2 doesn’t pay?
            </p>
            <p>
             And the BIN situation I brought up in the forum regarding Reserve auctions with a BIN option. Bid on a reserve auction on Day1 (below reserve price), buy same item on Day3 with BuyItNow.  Is that an auction bid/win or a BIN? Does it pay?
            </p>

             At first, after reading the latest announcement on pricing I was cautiously
             <br/>
             optimistic. I even contemplated returning to building a few new sites – this time
             <br/>
             tailored to attract and work within the new parameters and direction set by
             <br/>
             EPN.
            </p>
            <p>
             However Scott’s later clarifications have only served to put a stop to the above.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately I feel that in an attempt to dress up or lessen the true effect of
             <br/>
             the changes EPN have caused far more confusion than necessary.
             <br/>
             It certainly would have been more transparent for EPN to simply state that “We
             <br/>
             are changing the cookie length relating to bids. You will now only be rewarded
             <br/>
             for bids that take place within 24hrs of the click – this may extend the cookie
             <br/>
             length to 7 – 10 days. If an initial bid is placed 24hrs after the click then
             <br/>
             you will not be rewarded for this or subsequent bids”
            </p>
            <p>
             I certainly can understand the drive to lure new buyers but even many new
             <br/>
             buyers will wait until the later stages of an auction before bidding so as not
             <br/>
             to drive the price up. This provides little to no incentive for affiliates if we are
             <br/>
             expected to seek out those folks who have never bought on eBay then
             <br/>
             ensure that they bid within 24hrs of leaving our sites. We may well be
             <br/>
             successful in the almost impossible task of pre-qualifying the visitors we
             <br/>
             send to eBay only to find that they do nothing within the first 24hrs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course even if they don’t do anything within 24hrs eBay will have a new
             <br/>
             customer to the marketplace, found by its affiliates and with only the
             <br/>
             affiliate bearing the effort and cost.
            </p>
            <p>
             After repeated requests and much effort on our part we have built communities
             <br/>
             of regular buyers – we are now instructed to concentrate our efforts on
             <br/>
             targeting new and infrequent buyers. Not only do we have to deal with a
             <br/>
             complete about turn in direction but we also have to do this with a vastly
             <br/>
             reduced cookie length.
            </p>
            <p>
             The conversations I have had with many other eBay affiliates certainly seem to
             <br/>
             mirror by own thoughts on the above. Many seem to agree that these changes
             <br/>
             will serve only to reduce new and innovative projects to drive traffic and sales
             <br/>
             to eBay with many opting to direct their future affiliate efforts elsewhere.
            </p>
            <p>
             I doubt eBay/EPN will reverse the decision on cookie length for bids despite
             <br/>
             the feelings and actions of its affiliate “partners” which is disappointing to put it mildly.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally I don’t suppose that there would be a “good time” to implement changes
             <br/>
             like those reported here – but why do changes always seem to happen at a
             <br/>
             time when we should be actively promoting our sites and eBay ahead of the
            </p>
            <p>
             busiest trading period?

             Vehicles don’t pay like they used to since the change in Motors fees.
            </p>
            <p>
             High priced items in other categories would pay higher.  And while there may be a limit on a item, multiple qty purchases multiple that. Someone buying 20 pcs of an item from a multiple qty listing as gifts for instance would multiply the commission by 20.

             Totally feel the pain here with you if this hits us as hard as we all fear. Ultimately there will be those of us who are able to adapt and continue to thrive. If most of us don’t, then ultimately this will affect ebay, which will end up losing much of its afflliate sourced traffic. Does ebay really want to do that to us? I am hoping not. Because they need us as much as we need them.

             Thanks Clickimus Prime,
            </p>
            <p>
             You seem to have clarified that point for me which I was hoping was not what you said! Based on the ebay posts, it sounded like there were still more revelations to come about the pricing methodology. eg last sentence of ebay post above – “stay tuned for more information over the coming weeks”.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is in stark contrast, then, to the current methodology. I believe I am correct in saying that the exact formula that determines current EPC is not published anywhere. The forums are full of guesses and best guesses but no hard formula.
            </p>
            <p>
             So therefore the new formula will not take historical EPC into account whatsoever. Each new day will be a totally new EPC.
            </p>
            <p>
             It sounds to me like the daily volatility in EPC could be absolutely crazy, if it’s not being “dampened” by historical values….
            </p>
            <p>
             Thanks again for your input.

             Right. EPC will now coincide with WBR and clicks in a predictable way. Feel free to chart your own moving average if it makes you feel better. Maybe the new reporting will have that too. Not a bad idea.  At least we will know what the numbers mean now.

             I am writing my code to only call auctions that are 24 hours or less from expiring.  That means moving forward I will only show auctions that are ENDING, not ones that started.  That’s how I’m handing this one..   Not good for the eBay customer, though.   This eventually morphs us (using the API to retrieve auctions) into only showing expiring auctions in order to get (possibly) paid.  This could have some unwanted customer effects for eBay.  Hold on, this is going to be interesting.

             That is very useful to know … thanks Clickmus Prime.  I think I was quoting a UK ebay seller fees which might be structured differently, but most we could earn on US ebay seems to be between 40% and 80% on a maximum of $250 (the fee ebay charges seller) unless ebay pays 2 x base rate for introducing new buyer.  (Seems there could be a situation with new buyers where under rules we can potentially earn more than ebay gets paid from seller? if paid incentive rate on top of base rate).  That is good enough for me.  The important thing to have in mind is earnings are capped.  So no point busting a gut to sell a million dollar jet or the original schlinders list.

             You would without a doubt earn more than eBay gets in fees  on an item bought by new Type1 new users. The higher the item price the higher the triple payout. So potentially over $900 on one item.

             Over the lifetime of the typical user, eBay will make much more. They make money on all the buyer’s purchases, plus bids that might drive up prices, plus any items he sells, plus the referrals he might bring. They pay the bonus on the assumption that the buyer will stay engaged with eBay after his initial purchase and eventually generate more fees than they paid out. The old system placed higher value on encouraging that engagement. The more buyers there are and the more active they are overall, the better the eBay economy is.

             To tie in with the mission of optimising profits for Ebay, shouldn’t the employees who have come up with the idea, be aligned with affiliates ?
            </p>
            <p>
             ie. have their salaries in proportion to overall affiliate earnings.
             <br/>
             That’s what I would call a partnership.

             “And the BIN situation I brought up in the forum regarding Reserve
             <br/>
             auctions with a BIN option. Bid on a reserve auction on Day1 (below
             <br/>
             reserve price), buy same item on Day3 with BuyItNow.  Is that an auction
             <br/>
             bid/win or a BIN? Does it pay?”
            </p>
            <p>
             It should as there was as an action taken in the 24hr period, but we’ll have to see. Also the BIN disappears in all but four categories –
            </p>
            <p>
             Cell Phones &amp; Accessories
             <br/>
             Clothing, Shoes &amp; Accessories
             <br/>
             Motors Parts &amp; Accessories
             <br/>
             Tickets
            </p>
            <p>
             So unless the auction is in one of the above cats then the BIN would disappear.

             For most listings, except I was specifically referring to “reserve auctions”. The BIN shouldn’t disappear until the reserve is hit.
            </p>
            <p>
             In those 4 categories, the BIN should stay until price reaches 50% of the BIN price. Not sure how the two interact when both are applied in the categories.

             ePN – I have a lot of niche sites all pushing traffic to eBAY. I’ve been at this a very long time, supplying original content and reviews on a variety of products and niches. I work hard at adding site value for the benefit of prospective customers.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please tell me how I have any control on who visits my sites – new to eBay or old to eBay individuals? Do I now have a subscription policy and a person can only enter my sites if you admit to not having an eBay subscription and tell current members to go away?

             Scott, can you please just answer a straight question.
            </p>
            <p>
             If a bid is placed after the initial 24hrs, do we still get credit for it? That I think is the biggest concern at this point. If not, then you have just become Amazon.

             John,
            </p>
            <p>
             I have tried to answer the question as clearly as possible.
             <br/>
             The current 7-day referral period includes a latency factor that effectively paid less for transactions as time elapsed from the click to the purchase.  On October 1st, transactions will paid in full for the 24 hour referral
             <br/>
             period.  While this means that fewer transactions are credited for some of you, it also means that earnings
             <br/>
             are greater on those transactions that are credited.
            </p>
            <p>
             I hope this is clear.
            </p>

             “The current 7-day referral period includes a latency factor that effectively paid less for transactions as time elapsed from the click to the purchase.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes but we got something. Plus they might do more bids on other auctions which after Oct 1st gets us ZIP!
            </p>
            <p>
             “On October 1st, transactions will paid in full for the 24 hour referral period.”
            </p>
            <p>
             Which is what we are getting for that transaction now unless the QCP algorithm devalues the transaction within hours of the click. And even then the difference would be small.
            </p>
            <p>
             Yes there is an increase in some categories (reduction in others) over what was the base % paid but any partner with any volume would be at or above those levels ever since eBay switch for the 10 cent per bid schedule.

             “While this means that fewer transactions are credited for some of you, it also means that earnings

             are greater on those transactions that are credited.”

            <p>
             So with EPN moving to an ever more transparent setup
             <br/>
             are you able to put a percentage on the number of
             <br/>
             bids that are placed within 24hrs of click and those placed 24+ hrs – 7 days across the network?
            </p>
            <p>
             I appreciate your suggestion that only some of us will
             <br/>
             see fewer transactions and this perhaps will be
             <br/>
             balanced out with increased earning on bids within
             <br/>
             24hrs but  providing those numbers as a percentage
             <br/>
             may reassure folks and provide further clarity.

             Apologies if this has already been covered somewhere but this post says that the TDR will show the exact amount we will be paid per transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
             Please can someone confirm the exact column heading name for this. I assume the TDR is not showing the exact amount per transaction until 1 Oct.
            </p>
            <p>
             Also will there be a time included in the “Event Date” in the same way that the “Click Timestamp” shows Date and time. Then we can see how many hours have elapsed between click and event.
            </p>
            <p>
             Thank you in advance.

             The exact column name will probably be named “Earnings”, as mentioned in the blog post up above.
             <br/>
             As for an exact Event timestamp, that’s something a few of us have requested (noted elsewhere in these blog comments). Perhaps it’s already part of the plan.

             Why can’t you just answer a straight NO you will not get paid if the bid is made after 24hrs or YES you will get paid if the bid is made within 24 hrs AND the period will be extended from 7 to 10 days. How hard is that?

             Just how much confidence can you have in a program where you go to bed one day and six hours later the data that had been reported for a day and a half ago suddenly loses 75% of the reported clicks and the number of impressions goes to ZERO……..

             Scott, thanks a lot for explanation!
             <br/>
             On question though. What if buyer puts an item into the “Watch List”, but bids and wins several days later, close to the end of the auction. We brought you a valid buyer, and we don’t get anything for this?

             Well, I guess the new pricing results are pretty clear.  Used to have earnings every day– one niche site, small to moderate amounts — but every day there was something. Now….zero, zip, nada, nothing.  So, the conclusion is that the new pricing has effectively killed any value to being an affiliate.  Good job, gents.  Bravo.

             Well, it’s official. I’ll definitely going to continue removing my links to eBay. After earning a penny two days ago, I was outraged. Then, yesterday I earned .22 for 22 clicks for $4.93. I thought to myself, “Hmmm, let’s take a wait and see attitude.” Today it was 35 clicks for ZERO payout! So, in the past seven days I’ve had 93 clicks for a grand total earnings of $6.57. Absolutely unbelievable. I will tell everyone who I can think of to not even bother wasting their time with the idiots who run EPN because quite simply, they don’t care if we earn any money and they’re nothing but greedy fools who have ruined the entire EPN experience.
