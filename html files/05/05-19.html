         It took 10 months to find Mrs Snowball and 25 
      years to recognise her.

         In December 2007, I was asked out of the blue; 
      Grandpa, did you invent internet shopping? I thought about the question 
      and replied, No, but a very long time ago I was involved in something 
      called teleshopping. Years later it became internet shopping. I had to 
      think because I had long forgotten teleshopping as well as most of my 
      business career.

       </p>
       <p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 10">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         When the journey began to find the history of 
      online shopping I had no idea of the existence or relevance of Mrs 
      Snowball, who we subsequently discovered to be the worlds first online 
      home shopper. The starting point of the journey had been to try to 
      reconstruct the invention of online shopping. I had searched my personal 
      papers, old copies of Information Management in my study and all the 
      press cuttings I could find. The first conclusion was that I had neither a 
      good memory nor a well-organised information base. Both were my own fault. 
      My first task was to restore the information database to its original 
      standard.
        </font>
       </p>
       <p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 10">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         With the help of my wife, I recalled the 
      invention of teleshopping as it was then called and wrote the story. 
      Then I remembered the worlds first Business to Business [B2B] online 
      shopping system and the exchange of telexes when it went live. A mutual 
      friend put me in contact with Colin Palmer who, as Commercial Director of 
      Thomson Holidays in 1981, had been the client. He went searching his 
      papers and eventually came up with a number of press articles. Some months 
      later we found the original Information Management article with the 
      original telexes .We had solid evidence and there was optimism that we 
      could find more. I decided, therefore, to construct a digital Archive of 
      Pioneers of Online Shopping that would be donated to the Aldrich Library 
      at the University of Brighton and could be used by future generations for 
      teaching, learning, research and scholarship.

       <p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 10">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         In the meantime a great search for the 
      pioneering online shopping projects continued and we unearthed the Ford, 
      Peugeot-Talbot, Nissan, General Motors and Horizon Holidays stories which 
      provided a broad view of the B2B projects. Then we had some luck. We found 
      the City of Bradford Centrepoint story which consisted of 3 articles. The 
      Centrepoint project ran for many years and was a pioneering program to 
      provide public information and support services for citizens of Bradford 
      and particularly those who were disadvantaged. It is strange how with the 
      aid of written and photographic records it was easy to remember warmly the 
      project and the people involved. One of the services provided through 
      Centrepoint was teleshopping whereby in conjunction with Wm Morrison, 
      the large supermarket company, online shopping and home delivery for 4,000 
      grocery items were offered. We were excited that we had found the first 
      Business to Consumer [B2C] online shopping.

       </p>
       <p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 10">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         Reading the text carefully, however, we 
      learned that the Bradford teleshopping was modelled on the Gateshead 
      system! We gradually, vaguely remembered the Gateshead system. There was a 
      lovely white haired grandmother, Tesco, a memorable name, Mrs Snowball, 
      and a Council experimenting with services for its less advantaged 
      citizens. But we had no documentation. We couldnt recall her connection 
      to the Gateshead system.

       </p>
       <p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 10">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         We talked to everyone we could find who might 
      have information. We searched old cabinets and then we struck lucky. We 
      found a black and white photocopy of an Information Management article 
      about teleshopping in Gateshead. It was a poor, faded copy but it had a 
      photo of a woman identified as Mrs Jane Snowball! It raised more questions 
      than it answered. Was she an early user of the system or was she the first 
      user. The text of the article was too vague to be definitive. An old 
      friend, John Aeberhard, the founder of the A+ PR consultancy, had been our 
      PR Consultant in the 1980s and he remembered going to Gateshead with 
      Lawrence McGinty of ITN to do a shopping piece. We contacted Lawrence 
      McGinty who not only confirmed the trip but went looking in ITNs 
      non-digitised archive for the tape. We were getting close.

       <p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 10">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         We had established that there were only two 
      B2C systems in the 1980s and we had been responsible for both of them. B2C 
      online shopping did not become commercially viable until the internet 
      became widespread later in the 1990s. The 1980s projects had been 
      experiments run by City governments in partnership with supermarkets to 
      deliver services to senior citizens. One of our projects had to be the 
      first in the world. We had to find out which project first put a computer 
      device in a home and permitted goods to be ordered online and delivered. 
      On the face of it, Mrs Snowball was photographed using a specially 
      modified television connected down an ordinary telephone line to a 
      real-time transaction-processing computer. The caption said she was 
      ordering groceries from Tesco. It was our equipment. We knew that it was 
      capable of doing the job. But we had to prove it. Was she the first?

        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         In a box in the back of a garage we found some 
      old Redifon News copies and, lo and behold, some long lost Information 
      Managements. Information Management editions were never numbered 
      serially so we do not know, even now, whether we have a complete set. 
      Nonetheless, one of the editions, Spring/Summer 1984, had the original 
      Gateshead story in colour. We believe that the magazine was published in 
      June 1984. Therefore the latest date for the photo was early June. That 
      wasnt the best of the news. Tucked into the magazine was a pristine 
      re-print of an article from The Incorporated Engineer, the journal of 
      the IEEE, September 1984, p6. This article was written after the 
      Information Management article and contained the following piece of 
      information:

       </p>
       <p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 10">
        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         The article was titled, Videotex takes 
      Gateshead Teleshopping into the Home and it carried the same photograph 
      as in Information Management of Mrs Jane Snowball, 72, using the system. 
      We had the worlds first online home shopper.

         Early in September 2008 I wrote to Roger 
      Kelly, the Chief Executive of Gateshead Council and told him of our 
      discovery, asked him if the authority had any material we could add to the 
      archive and suggested that it might be appropriate to recognise Mrs 
      Snowball in some way. There was a very positive response. The Council set 
      out to discover Mrs Snowball. It wasnt easy but eventually they found one 
      of their social workers who remembered the family. Sadly Mrs Snowball was 
      no longer alive but her relatives had been identified. Moreover, with the 
      permission of her family, we were going to recognise her in a respectful 
      and thoughtful manner.

        <font face="Arial" size="2">
         As the research continued, we found that the 
      Gateshead Shopping Experiment had been largely instigated by a lecturer in 
      the geography department of the University of Newcastle, Ross Davies. 
      Professor Ross Davies went on to found the Oxford Institute of Retail 
      Management at Templeton College, Oxford. He became the father of UK 
      retailing e-commerce and one of the leading intellectual forces behind 
      modern retailing. Gateshead was a milestone on the road to modern 
      e-retailing.

         On Friday 9th January 2009, after much effort 
      by John Aeberhard and Marc Lecomber of ITN Source, we found and watched 
      Mrs Snowball being interviewed by Lawrence McGinty as she did her online 
      shopping. Our luck had held because the original tape had deteriorated 
      over the years but the 3 minutes we needed was still good. Mrs Snowball 
      was every bit as charming as people had remembered.

         Jule Wilson of Gateshead Council was given the 
      task of organizing a suitable commemoration and celebration of Mrs 
      Snowball. This did not prove to be easy. A number of ideas were explored 
      but were not pursued for practical reasons .Finally it was decided to 
      organise a media event at the Civic Centre in Gateshead and make a 
      commemorative presentation to a member of Mrs Snowballs family to 
      celebrate a unique achievement. Fortunately, the family were in agreement 
      and Mrs Snowballs son Derek agreed to be the recipient of the 
      presentation. May 12th 2009 was set for the Civic Centre event. We were 
      going to recognise and honour Mrs Snowball on the 25th Anniversary of her 
      epic purchase. [

         It had been a long, difficult, exhilarating 
      and, ultimately, joyful search. Mrs Snowball started an industry that in 
      2008 recorded in the UK alone some £50 billion in online retail shopping. 
      Worldwide the sum was probably over $500 billion. No industry was ever 
      launched with a fairer face.
